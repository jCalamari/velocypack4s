### Velocypack Scala module

An alternative implementation of [Java VelocyPack](https://github.com/arangodb/java-velocypack) for Scala.

The objective is to allow seamless use with Scala without the need to write boilerplate and error-prone Velocypack serializer/deserializer conversions yourself.

#### Modules

The library is composed by these modules:

    - shapeless: seralizer/deserializer generation using shapeless
